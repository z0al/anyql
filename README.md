# AnyQL (codename)

Abstract helpers for data-driven JavaScript apps built on the top of [Redux Saga][saga]. Inspired by [Apollo Client][apollo].

## Design

### Goals / Principles

- Idiomatic Redux
- No magic, no lock-in
- Query language agnostic
- Convention over configuration

### Non-goals / Out of scope

- Compatibility (or competing) with Apollo client (or similar library)
- Specific Query Language support (e.g. GraphQL)

## Roadmap

- [ ] Basic query support (share your [feedback][basic-query])
	- [x] Resolving queries
	- [x] Loading indication
	- [x] Handling query errors
	- [x] Cancellation support
	- [ ] Pagination support
- [ ] Add cache helpers (get by ID, invalidate ..etc)
- [ ] Support mutations (i.e. write queries)
- [ ] Support streaming
- [ ] TBD. Have something? Open an [issue][issue]


## Acknowledgments

This project wouldn't have been possible without the following great libraries:

* [React][react]: For all the hooks and re-rendering
* [Redux][redux]: For not once complaining about how many Todo apps it witnessed
* [Redux Saga][saga]: For helping us avoid the pain of forking [nocode][nocode]
* [TSDX][tsdx]: For making dealing with TypeScript no implicit any

Also, a special thanks to Apollo's team for their amazing work on [Apollo Client][apollo] from which we copied some concepts.
