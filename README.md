## Acknowledgments

This project wouldn't have been possible without the following great libraries:

* [React][react]: For all the hooks and re-rendering
* [Redux][redux]: For not once complaining about how many Todo apps it witnessed
* [Redux Saga][saga]: For helping us avoid the pain of forking [nocode][nocode]
* [TSDX][tsdx]: For making dealing with TypeScript no implicit any

Also, a special thanks to Apollo's team for their amazing work on [Apollo Client][apollo] from which we copied some concepts.
